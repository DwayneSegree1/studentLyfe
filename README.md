# studentLyfe
We have realized that there is a disconnect between incoming freshman, campus life and academics. Our priority with studentLfe is bridging the gap between all parties, we aim to implement fast and effective solutions to facilitate better student life on university campuses. StudentLyfe offers the oppertunity to students within the university system to signup for mentortorship no matter their clasification. StudentLyfe aims to create a space where alumni can reconnect with each other and catch up on old times as well as keep uptodate with their alma mater. The project is being developed using github, react native, expo, node js and firebase.
